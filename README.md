# Overview

As a Cloud Architect, I recognize the enormous business value that rapid 
prototying & extreme programming principles provide to a global IT 
workforce. 

The tools outlined below enable Developers, DevOps Engineers, &
Designers the ability to define, isolate, & automate dependencies to 
create a reproducible & automated application / infrastructure 
environment.

The goal of this toolbox is to provide any individual with a framework
to get started implementing the use of these tools for use-cases which
benefit them.
 

# Features
The tools below require you download/install them on your target system(s)
before using any of the examples in the folders.  

## Wiki Content:
 The wiki contains key information outlining general usage of the tools:
 
 https://github.com/cappetta/SecDevOps-Toolkit/wiki
 
    - Git Secrets - eliminate sensitive data from being committed
    - AWS Setup - obtaining api keys and setting up a cli
    - terraform -  general usage & argument syntax
    - vagrant - create & share a
    - puppet/ansible - configuraction mgmt tooling
    - docker - 
    
## Vagrant 
    Use-Case: Create & Provision Infrastructure

# Other Tools
## Docker
Everyone Loves Containers so here's an Awesome Docker Link:

## Chocolately  
Described as the the "apt-get for windows".  There are currently 4,863 
software packages available for install.  Using chocolately allows us to
leverage a large repository of programs.  

* URL: https://chocolatey.org/packages



### Execution:
It is executed through the windows shell thru a 'terraform apply' step. 
This has not yet been introduced into the vagrantfile & tested but it is
reasonably possible to do so.
 

chocolately is installed and automatically available for any combination of software installs
cli use: ```terraform apply -target=aws_instance.win2016_base -var 'software=winrar googlechrome notepadplusplus flashplayerplugin jre8'```
variables.mf - this is a file where you can set the variables & associated values


challenges - does the software that gets installed = valid testing condition

## Puppet


# Data Organization

## Vagrant - yaml

vagrant has 2 primary yaml files.  One is the aws.yaml file which has the following format & holds the credentials of the user.
```
---
access_key='xxxxx'
secret_key='xxxxx'
```

## Terraform - hcl/json 
Terraform requires manifests, essentially blueprints, which provide instructions on the resources and assets to create.  All resources have variablized attributes where defaults are stored in the variables.tf file and over-riden via commandline parameter.  For example:

declare a variable for ami:
```
var amazon_ami {
  description = 'This is an example variable for amazon ami settings'
  default = ami-xyzxyz
}
```

This command would override the default variable value and set the variable to ami-abcabc
```
terraform apply --target=aws_instance.example_instance -var 'amazon_ami=ami-abcabc'
```
